###Leanback

Simple Ruby Interface to CouchDB. 

This project is still under development. Not complete by any means. I made this Gem to use in my projects. I will expose more CouchDB features soon.

##Goals
* To create a simple Ruby Interface to CouchDB
* Expose the features of CouchDB to the Ruby Lang., 
* Use a minimalist Ruby DSL to access CouchDB
* provide a very easy way to persist and retrieve data

##Compatibility
Upgraded and tested on CouchDB 1.2.0. CouchDB 1.0.1 should still work fine.
