###Leanback

Simple Ruby Interface to CouchDB.

This project is still under development. Not complete by any means. I made this Gem to use in my projects. I will expose more CouchDB features soon.

4-19-2014: I hope i can refactor most of the code. It is dated and needs it.

##Goals
* To create a simple Ruby Interface to CouchDB
* Expose the features of CouchDB to the Ruby Lang.,
* Use a minimalist Ruby DSL to access CouchDB
* provide a very easy way to persist and retrieve data

##Compatibility
Upgraded and tested on CouchDB 1.4.0. and 1.5.0.
